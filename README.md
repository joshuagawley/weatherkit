# weatherkit

A Rust library which provides bindings for the WeatherKit REST API.

## Usage

Frontends using this library must provide the necessary assets for generating developer tokens via the ``TokenAssets``
struct (details on how to generate these can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi/request_authentication_for_weatherkit_rest_api)).
